## **About**

I'm a PhD student at [Purdue University](https://purdue.edu/), advised by [Prof. Jing Gao](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~jinggao/index.html) and [Prof. Xiaoqian Wang](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~joywang/). I hold a Master's Degree with honors from [Zhejiang University (China)](https://www.zju.edu.cn/) and a Bachelor's Degree with honors from [Northeastern University (China)](https://www.neu.edu.cn/).
